Smith**](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/thomasjsmithmeng) @TheSmiff\r\n\r\n**David Mahmoodi** @DMahmoodi\r\n\r\n### Abstract\r\nA set of 6 online Partial Discharge measurements were given to the Project Team. The task was to build a MATLAB program that analyses the data using a technique called Pulse Sequence Analysis. A program with advanced features was successfully developed and demonstrated:\r\n* An intuitive GUI based interface\r\n* Online signal denoising using wavelet packets,\r\n* Pulse Sequence Analysis algorithm and graph plotting,\r\n* Feature extraction using competitive neural networks,\r\n* Computer automated analysis by comparing features between data sets.\r\n\r\nThe program executed on a standard PC in less than 30 seconds. In the final presentation, the team were able to characterise the Partial Discharge using the graphs produced in Pulse Sequence Analysis. This was confirmed using the automated feature extraction and comparison. All source code is provided in the repository.\r\n\r\n![The PD Characterisation Tool](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2952791/4515149/9bb2fc5a-4bab-11e4-994b-2bd5d556b27e.png)\r\n\r\nVM(path = \"http://vimeo.com/107992830\", width = 640, height = 360, copy2clip = interactive(), print = FALSE)\r\n\r\n###Presentation\r\nFind the presentation here: [Presentation.pptx](https://github.com/TheSmiff/ELEC6089-PD-Analysis/blob/master/PD_Presentation%20(1).pptx?raw=true)\r\n\r\n###Contact\r\nFor further information: [Thomas J Smith](mailto:tsmiff@live.co.uk)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
